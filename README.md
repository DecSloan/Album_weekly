# Album_weekly
**Saving the info for my Album weekly project that I want to turn into an app**

---

## Initial thoughts & ideas 

I want to create an app that simply shows a new random album each week with easy links for people to listen. 
I want people to enjoy an album in full as intended by the artist. Introduce people to new music, both old and new. 
Include a review written by myself with insight into the sound/process.
 
### Data on each album to include

**ID** - a number so I can select an album at random using rd.choice

**Name** - album name 

**Artist** - band or artist 

**Length** - total runtime of album, displayed in mins if under 60 else hours and mins

**Year** - the year that the album was first released

**Vibe** - 3 words or phrases that describe to overall feel, separated by /

**FavSong**  - my chosen favourite song from the album

**Review** - self written review about chosen album, include when is perfect listening time and any fun facts

**Spotify** - link to spotify/other music sources to listen easily

**Website** - link to band/artist website or bandcamp page to buy music/merch direct from them

**Cover** - need a visual of the cover, would also like to choose a background colour based off the colour pallete

**Used** - need a indicator that the album has already been used and wont be used again for some time e.g. at least a year
