## III

Naxatras are a psychedelic rock band hailing from Greece, this is their third album and my favourite. Sit back, unwind and be transported on an epic journey,  meandering through a landscape of big percussive drums, layers of silky smooth guitars and low stabs of bass heavy echoey reverb. The songs build up slowly, drawing you in with a stripped back and honest approach, sprinkled with wandering guitar solos, catchy repeated hooks and the occasional use of alluring vocals. This album has it all, just after the middle things really slow down and take a dark turn but stick with it and you will be greatly rewarded. When listening to this album I can’t help but be reminded of early - mid 70’s Pink Floyd, but maybe a little more succinct in style. The album has a fantastic flow to it, keeping you totally captivated, even throughout the slightly longer runtime, something that I feel is hugely lacking with this modern age of musicians. My favourite time to listen to this album is on a lazy sunny Sunday, however it also sounds great accompanying a beautiful sunset or a chilled evening with friends.
