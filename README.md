## III

Naxatras are a psychedelic rock band hailing from Greece, this is their third album and my favourite. Sit back, unwind and be transported on an epic journey,  meandering through a landscape of big percussive drums, layers of silky smooth guitars and low stabs of bass heavy echoey reverb. The songs build up slowly, drawing you in with a stripped back and honest approach, sprinkled with wandering guitar solos, catchy repeated hooks and the occasional use of alluring vocals. This album has it all, just after the middle things really slow down and take a dark turn but stick with it and you will be greatly rewarded. When listening to this album I can’t help but be reminded of early - mid 70’s Pink Floyd, but maybe a little more succinct in style. The album has a fantastic flow to it, keeping you totally captivated, even throughout the slightly longer runtime, something that I feel is hugely lacking with this modern age of musicians. My favourite time to listen to this album is on a lazy sunny Sunday, however it also sounds great accompanying a beautiful sunset or a chilled evening with friends.

## An Awesome Wave

Alt-J scooped the mercury music prize in 2012 and with good reason, this album is all killer no filler. Rich in dynamic low end bass as well as more classical instruments from piano to acoustic guitar, it manages to keep a firm footing in both while producing something greater than the sum of its parts. The addition of distorted and often whacky vocals to catchy and simple melodies produces a very different, but also a somehow relatable and inclusive,  sound that invites listeners to become part of the music. All of these elements weave together beautifully to give this album a totally unique sound and one that refuses to be defined by a moment in time or single genre. It still sounds as fresh and innovative as it did more than a decade ago when it was first released, no mean feat when most of pop music was shifting towards generic singles and one hit wonders that would be rapidly regurgitated in a seemingly endless cycle. I like to listen to this album when I first wake up, with a gentle intro to ease you into the day, it is always guaranteed to put me in a good mood.
